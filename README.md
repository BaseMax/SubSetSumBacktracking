# Sub Set Sum Backtracking

This is an implementation of the Sub Set Sum Backtracking algorithm in C. The algorithm is used to find a subset of a given set of numbers that adds up to a given sum. The algorithm is implemented using backtracking.

## Usage

To compile the program, run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o subsetsum subsetsum.c
```

To run the program, run the following command:

```bash
./subsetsum
```

## Example

```bash
Enter the number of elements: 5
Enter the elements: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter the sum: 10
The subset is: 1 2 3 4
```

The program will print the subset of numbers that add up to the given sum.
